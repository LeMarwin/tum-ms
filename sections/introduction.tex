\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Hyperledger Fabric employs a complicated network architecture. It's key part is the ordering service. Every transaction must eventually be sent to the orderer to be included in a block. Moreover, to avoid forks there can be only one ordering service in Fabric's network.

Also, since Fabric's transaction lifecycle separates the endorsement phase from the ordering or "adding to a block" phase and because of the extra network delays caused by this extra step, a lot of transactions become invalid by the time they reach the commit phase.

These factors make the ordering service a natural bottleneck and a prime target for optimization.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problemStatement}

The project targets a specific situation when the exact order of transactions is not relevant. For these cases, the best optimization is to remove the ordering phase altogether.

Even in the case when the order of transactions can be arbitrary, we would like to retain some properties of the original system.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Require endorsement of transactions according to a policy
  \item Keep a ledger of transactions
  \item Tamper-proof the ledger
\end{itemize}

The goal of the project is to create a premissioned blockchain based on Hyperledger Fabric that implements a transaction lifecycle without the ordering phase.

\section{Approach}
 \label{sec:approach}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Assume only conflict-free transactions.
  \item The world state is represented by a conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT).
  \item Keep the ordering service for configuration transactions and chaincode initialization.
  \item Keep the blockchain, pack transactions into blocks.
\end{itemize}

 Since there is no ordering system, there will be no consensus on the exact order of transactions. Nonetheless, this is not a problem, since CRDTs guarantee a consensus on the world state, provided that all transactions are committed to all peers. The approach is then to keep a separate, local blockchain on each peer node with it's own order.

 The new transaction lifecycle is as follows.
 The client sends transaction proposals to all endorsing peers as usual and collects endorsments. The endorsed transaction is then sent to all peers in the network. A peer receives the endorsed transaction, checks the signatures according to chain's policy and commits the transaction. After the transaction is committed, the peer send the client a receipt with the hash of the block the transaction was commited to. The client consideres the transaction as committed once it receives receipts from all peers.
