Hyperledger Fabric provides a convenient framework for creating blockchain solutions. Like everything, it has room for improvement. One obvious improvement is the optimization of the ordering service. It is a bottleneck of the transaction flow and adds network delays which increase the chance of transactions becoming invalid. This thesis focuses on a specific scenario when transactions are conflict-free and commutative by design making the exact order of transactions not important. Under these circumstances the ordering service becomes redundant. Removal of the ordering service and the consequences of an orderless approach to Fabric is the topic of this thesis.
